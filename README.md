# Wrangling-of-Automobile-Data
I performed Data Wrangling on dataset containing various details about different automobiles. It is the process of converting data from the initial format to a format that may be better for analysis.

After completing this lab I am able to:
  1. Handle missing values
  2. Correct data format
  3. Standardize and normalize data

The tasks I performed are:
  1. Identify and handle missing values:
      a. Identify missing values
      b. Deal with missing values
      c. Correct data format
  2. Data standardization
  3. Data normalization (centering/scaling)
  4. Binning
  5. Indicator variable

The dataset 'auto.csv' contains missing values and it cannot be used for analysis as the data is not normalized. I performed the above steps and cleaned the dataset and normalized it. Now it is more suited for analysis than before. 'cleaned_auto.csv' is the resultant dataset.
